# ML_Project: Cybersecurity Attack Outcome Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the outcome of a cybersecurity attack (Success or Failure) using a machine learning model. The web integration allows users to input attack details through a user-friendly interface and get predictions based on trained machine learning models.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Training:** The `ML_Project_2.ipynb` file trains multiple models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Decision Tree) and selects the best-performing model.
- **Web Integration:** A Flask-based web application allows users to input features and get predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Frontend interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless user interaction.
